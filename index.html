      <h3>Car Price Prediction Model</h3>
      <p>Developed an advanced Car Price Prediction Model using linear regression techniques on a comprehensive Kaggle dataset. The model leverages key features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more to provide highly accurate predictions of car prices. This project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to achieve a reliable and robust predictive model. By analyzing and understanding the intricate relationships within the data, the model offers a valuable tool for predicting car prices, making it easier for users to assess vehicle value in the automotive market.
