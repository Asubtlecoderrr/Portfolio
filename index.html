      üöÄ <strong>Hi there, I‚Äôm a builder of smart stuff!</strong><br>
      I‚Äôm a software developer who lives and breathes GenAI, Machine Learning, and all things backend. By day, I craft scalable systems and GenAI-powered apps at <strong>SAP Labs</strong>, and by night, I‚Äôm probably tinkering with a new LangChain or RAG experiment just for fun (and learning, of course üòÑ).
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="200">
      ‚öôÔ∏è I love solving real-world problems with cutting-edge tech ‚Äî from automating tedious workflows and building centralized data hubs to making AI-powered chatbots that <em>actually</em> get you. My mission? To make apps smarter, systems faster, and experiences more human.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="400">
      üß† Whether it‚Äôs simplifying complex decision-making with AI or making machines sound less like robots, I‚Äôm all about blending logic with creativity to build tech that works <em>with</em> people, not just for them. If it involves AI + backend + impact ‚Äî I‚Äôm <strong>in</strong>. üí°

      <h3>Car Price Prediction Model</h3>
      <p>Developed an advanced Car Price Prediction Model using linear regression techniques on a comprehensive Kaggle dataset. The model leverages key features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more to provide highly accurate predictions of car prices. This project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to achieve a reliable and robust predictive model. By analyzing and understanding the intricate relationships within the data, the model offers a valuable tool for predicting car prices, making it easier for users to assess vehicle value in the automotive market.
